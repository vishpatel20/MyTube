          The world is an amazing place to visit. Coming from a person who travels every year to a 
          different place in the world, I can say that I learn something new every year and get to 
          experience some of the most amazing things that this world has to offer. I have traveled to
          Orlando, Los Angeles, Road trip of Massachusetts and nexy year I will be going to Hawaii. Getting
          out of my comfort zone and trying new things has benefitted me in so many ways and gives me a 
          new outlook on life.
